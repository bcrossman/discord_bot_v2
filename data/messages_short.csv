I am replying via Siri, so excuse any typos while I am driving, but from a practical standpoint, you should be able to find a small to medium sized firm for your market that provides all three. The question is how much accounting work, and if they are preparing any financial statements for you, they are going to want to maintain independence from actually preparing bookkeeping and journal entries to then having to do any sort of audit/review procedures on those accounting records to prepare financial statements. I bet Brent is probably a little more familiar with the size firms that do this type of thing."

"Hoxn8r",2023-05-02T02:36:11.825Z,"BREAKING NEWS:

The 8th and final Commissioners Award goes to someone who truly embodies what it is to be a part of this league. Equal parts humble and legendary, <@705788703716409355> is our final award winner. Ever committed to the pure entertainment of this league, his HB1 Tyrique Thornton, who is refusing to re-sign, has had his Injury and Toughness dropped to 1. Let's see what unfolds."
"Hoxn8r",2023-05-02T02:24:21.528Z,"BREAKING NEWS:

The 7th Commissioners Award goes to <@572953995325341706> for having the worst player rostered by a human owner! QB3 Matt Corral bottoms the charts with a stunning 63 OVR. As a firm believer in second chances and that I'm a God amongst men, Matt Corral's age has been reset from 33 to 20, his contract has been extended 7 years, and he shalt be named Matt St. Corral going forward. Peace be with you."

"Hoxn8r",2023-05-02T02:03:42.821Z,"BREAKING NEWS:

The 5th Commissioners Award goes to <@797589470269800468> who's CB2 Alani Williams leads the league in pass deflections! Almost as shocking, Williams has ZERO INTERCEPTIONS. If he gets one in the second half of the season, he might be taking it to the house with his newly maxed out break tackle, ball carrier vision, and carrying. (Don't worry, he's not a kick returner, I checked...)"
